# Language_Detection
This project focuses on detecting the language of a given text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging machine learning models and linguistic features, the system accurately classifies input text into its corresponding language. The project is useful for applications such as multilingual text processing, automated translations, and content filtering.

## Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Tokenizing, cleaning, and normalizing text data.
Feature Extraction: Using character-level n-grams and TF-IDF representations.
Model Training: Implementing machine learning classifiers such as Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Ensemble  models for language classification.
Evaluation: Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Methodology
Dataset Collection: Using multilingual text datasets from sources like Wikipedia, OpenSubtitles, or Europarl.
Preprocessing: Removing special characters, handling case sensitivity, and normalizing text.
Feature Engineering: Extracting character-level and word-level features.
Model Selection: Training and evaluating models such as Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Logistic Regression
Testing & Validation: Evaluating model accuracy on unseen multilingual text.
